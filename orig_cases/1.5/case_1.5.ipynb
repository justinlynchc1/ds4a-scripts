In this case, you will: (1) pre-process the data to transform it into a format amenable to later analysis; (2) utilize simple plotting functionality in Python to explore relationships between energy consumption in the electric power sector and electricity generation from nuclear electric power; (3) identify any patterns in energy usage and generation and how they change over time; and finally (4) use advanced plotting functionality to determine which sectors consume the most energy and how this has evolved over time."
